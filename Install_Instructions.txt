*** Manual Install of the NCNR SANS/USANS Procedures ***-------------------------------------------------------------------
If you were directed by the installer to perform a manual install, it is most likely because you do not have the proper permissions to copy the files into the necessary subfolders of the Igor Pro application folder.-------------------First, if possible, contact your system administrator. See if it is possible to grant you full read/write access to these three folders:(on Windows)/Program Files/WaveMetrics/Igor Pro/Igor Help Files/Program Files/WaveMetrics/Igor Pro/Igor Extensions/Program Files/WaveMetrics/Igor Pro/User Procedures(on Mac OSX)/Applications/Igor Pro/Igor Help Files/Applications/Igor Pro/Igor Extensions/Applications/Igor Pro/User ProceduresIf you or someone can reset the permissions on these folders so you can read and write, then re-run the installer, and it should work correctly without errors.If you can't get full permissions, you may still be able to use the macros. You must have at a minimum, permission to install in /User Procedures. If you can't get permission to install into /Igor Help Files, you can still open the help files manually as needed. If you can't get permission to install into /Igor Extensions, your calculations will be much slower, and you will not have access to any of the 2D analysis functions.------------------If you want to move the files and folders by hand, follow these steps, skipping those operations that you do not have permission to do:(0) Quit Igor, if it is open.(1) Clean out ALL of the older versions of the NCNR macros from the User Procedures folder. Move them to the trash/recycle, and be sure to EMPTY the trash/recycle. The files to remove will have a variety of names. See the listing at the bottom of this file.(2) Clean out all of the older versions of the NCNR Help Files from the Igor Help Files folder. Move them to the trash/recycle, and be sure to EMPTY the trash/recycle. Again, see the listing of possible names at the bottom of this file.(3) Clean out all of the older versions of the NCNR Extensions from the Igor Extensions folder. Move them to the trash/recycle, and be sure to EMPTY the trash/recycle. Again, see the listing of possible names at the bottom of this file.(4) From the downloaded package, move the entire folder NCNR_User_Procedures to the Igor Pro/User Procedures folder.(5) Move the entire folder NCNR_Help_Files to the Igor Pro/Igor Help Files folder.(6) In the NCNR_Extensions folder, move EITHER the Mac_XOP folder or the Win_XOP folder to Igor Pro/Igor Extensions, depending on your operating system. Delete the XOP for the platform that you are not using.(7) The NCNR_SANS_Utilities folder has the three templates for starting SANS or USANS Reduction experiment, and for an analysis experiment. If the templates open up correctly, you're likely OK. In this folder, there are also example data sets and a template for writing your own analysis model.
